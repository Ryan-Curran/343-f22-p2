My app takes an inputted word and finds 10 movies based off of that word using a movie database API.
It then uses the 10 movies release date, and queries another API to find a historical event that happened
on the month/day that the movie was released. It does take a bit to display the information but I did
not have time to optimize it. It satisfies the requirements by combining the data from two different
APIs. It is responsive because I used div elements and paragraphs to display information. It also displays
the results onto the webpage albeit it is slow. I was unable to figure out how to use the data from the 
search box's event listener in order to use it in the filter button's action listener so the buttons do
not do anything. If you know an easy way to use values found when in an action listener when outside of
that action listener please let me know, but I suspect the trouble I was having was in how I implemented
my event listener.
